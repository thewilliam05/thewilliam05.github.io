			<h1>&#9825; William's Page &#9825;</h1>

			<h1 style="font-weight:900;"><strong>Hello? H-Hello? Hello! FNAF reference.</strong></h1>
			<p>This is William here. You can call me William. But a title would be pretty cool.
			Check out my website! It's got little trinkets and statements and images that make me feel amused and/or happy 
			whenever I set my eyes on them. Anyhow this is formatted real real badly. There's obviously a way to make it 
			better however I did not elect to sink anymore effort in. All it takes is a google search, reading and some 
			trial and error. You can put whatever your heart desires &#9825;.</p>
